# ChristmasBalls

**Note**: Korney and Pantelei were decorating the Christmas tree with balls. They had 4 yellow balls and 8 red balls in the box. In one turn you can take any number of red balls or any number of yellow balls or an equal number of red and yellow balls from the box and hang them on the tree. The winner is the one who hangs the last balloon!
